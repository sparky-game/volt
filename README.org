* Project management

GitHub is the system we use to track feature requests, bug reports and other requested work. Different projects are created to separate concerns and responsabilities:

- [[https://github.com/orgs/sparky-game/projects/2][Roadmap]]
- User feedback /(Coming soon!)/

* Documentation

The documentation of /Volt/ includes:

- [[https://github.com/sparky-game/volt/wiki][Main documentation]]
- Reference manual /(Coming soon!)/
- API documentation /(Coming soon!)/

* Usage

(...)

* Build from source

In order to build /Volt/ from source, preparation is needed so as to the environment is properly setup and ready.

** Get the code

First, download the codebase of the project. It's important to do so via the *OFFICIAL* Git repository hosted on [[https://github.com/sparky-game/volt][GitHub]], and not through any tarball or compressed archive to ensure no tampering is done with the code. Appart from that, any ref can be checked out, being ~master~ (the trunk of all dev progress), a tagged commit (e.g. ~v1.0~), an actively maintained version branch (e.g. ~v1.0.y/stable~) or a LTS version branch (e.g. ~v1.0.y/lts~) the preferred ones.

To clone the official repo as well as all its submodules, issue the following command:

#+begin_src sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sparky-game/volt
#+end_src

Alternatively, to update an existing clone you can issue the following commands:

#+begin_src sh
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
#+end_src

** Configuration

(...)

#+begin_src sh
cmake -B build [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug]
#+end_src

** Compilation and linkage

(...)

#+begin_src sh
cmake --build build
#+end_src

(...)
