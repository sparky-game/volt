* Project management

GitHub is the system we use to track feature requests, bug reports and other requested work. Different projects are created to separate concerns and responsabilities:

- [[https://github.com/orgs/sparky-game/projects/2][Roadmap]]
- User feedback /(Coming soon!)/

* Documentation

The documentation of /Volt/ includes:

- [[https://github.com/sparky-game/volt/wiki][Main documentation]]
- Reference manual /(Coming soon!)/
- API documentation /(Coming soon!)/

* Usage

/Volt/ is first and foremost a *statically linked library* that acts as the engine itself.

(...)

It also provides a builtin application that acts as the official *editor*, where you can customize every aspect of your project, debug it, build it and ship it to the end user. This is a *WYSIWYG*-style editor (i.e. *What You See Is What You Get*), meaning that everything done in the editor will be exactly reflected on the final product.

(...)

* Build from source

In order to build /Volt/ from source, preparation is needed so as to the environment is properly setup and ready.

** Get the code

First, download the codebase of the project. It's important to do so via the *OFFICIAL* Git repository hosted on [[https://github.com/sparky-game/volt][GitHub]], and not through any tarball or compressed archive to ensure no tampering is done with the code. Appart from that, any ref can be checked out, being ~master~ (the trunk of all dev progress), a tagged commit (e.g. ~v1.0~), an actively maintained version branch (e.g. ~v1.0.y/stable~) or a LTS version branch (e.g. ~v1.0.y/lts~) the preferred ones.

To clone the official repo as well as all its submodules, issue the following command:

#+begin_src sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sparky-game/volt
#+end_src

Alternatively, to update an existing clone you can issue the following commands:

#+begin_src sh
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
#+end_src

** Configuration

This project uses *CMake* as its build system, so make sure to have it installed and available to use before proceeding.

#+begin_src sh
cmake -B build [-D...]
#+end_src

If wanted to *debug* /Volt/ as part of the development process, we can use the ~CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE~ variable to target the /Debug/ build type (its set to /Release/ by default). Note that this procedure only applies to *single-configuration generators*; if that isn't your case (i.e. /Ninja Multi-Config/, /Visual Studio/, /Xcode/, etc.), you can already change between build types without worrying about it.

Both *C and C++ compilers* can be manually specified by using the ~CMAKE_C_COMPILER~ and ~CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER~ variables. By default, the project gives priority to /Clang/ ahead of other compilers.

If *cross-compiling* is our thing, we can use the ~CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE~ variable to specify the target we want to build /Volt/ for (e.g. ~cmake/cross/mingw-x86_64.cmake~ to cross-compile to /MinGW x86_64/ target, i.e. /Win64/).

** Compilation and linkage

This step is orchestrated by the native build tool. After the project has been configured and build files have been generated, the only thing left is to compile and link all defined targets of /Volt/.

#+begin_src sh
cmake --build build
#+end_src
